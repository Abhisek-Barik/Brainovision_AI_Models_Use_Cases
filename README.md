## 📌 Project Overview  
This project was built during my ✨AI/ML Internship at Brainovision Solutions Pvt. Ltd.✨ as a mini-project assigned by **Pavan Sir**.

The goal was to:

- Analyze a dataset of top **AI models vs. Use Cases**
- Normalize technical benchmarking metrics across 10 skill areas
- Build a recommender system that:
  - Matches input use case to dataset 🎯
  - Identifies the **best AI model** for the task 🤖
  - Detects the **ML task type** intelligently 🧠
  - Visualizes model performance clearly 📊

---

## 📊 Features

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis of AI models and use cases  
✅ Shows all available AI tools and use cases  
✅ Fuzzy-matching based user input for ease of access  
✅ Normalized scoring across 10 core attributes  
✅ Auto-identification of best model for any task  
✅ ML task type detection: Classification, Regression, Clustering, or Sequence Generation  
✅ Clean and colorful bar plots for visual comparison  
✅ Beginner-friendly & interactive output with emojis

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

| Tool / Library         | Purpose                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 🐍 Python 3.9          | Core Programming Language        |
| 📓 Jupyter Notebook    | Interactive Development          |
| 📦 Pandas              | Data Loading & Manipulation      |
| 📈 Seaborn, Matplotlib | Data Visualization               |
| 🔄 Scikit-learn        | MinMax Normalization             |
| 💬 Difflib             | Fuzzy Text Matching for Use Case |

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Clone or open the notebook
2. Enter a use case when prompted (e.g., `translation`, `math problem solving`)
3. The notebook:
   - Fuzzily matches your query to the closest valid use case  
   - Filters and normalizes performance scores for all models on that task  
   - Computes a final score and identifies the **best AI model**  
   - Shows the model’s **top 3 strengths** and **ML task type**  
   - Generates a **bar chart** of all model performances for comparison

## 📎 Dataset Columns

| Category          | Columns |
|-------------------|---------|
| Categorical        | `AI Model`, `Use Case` |
| Benchmark Metrics  | `Logic`, `Reasoning`, `Coding`, `Maths`, `Creativity`, `Memory`, `Speed`, `Accuracy`, `Comprehension`, `Multimodal` |

All metrics are scaled (0–1) using MinMaxScaler and combined into a 100-point total score.

## 🙌 Ideal For:

- AI/ML learners exploring real-world model comparison  
- Portfolio projects for internships or job interviews  
- Anyone interested in benchmarking AI tools for specific tasks  
- Data Science mini-project presentations
